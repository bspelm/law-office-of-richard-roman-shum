<br>
<br>New York has two main types of divorce cases:
<br>
<br>Uncontested Divorce:
<br>In an uncontested divorce, the couple agrees to end their marriage without disputes over key issues like property division, alimony, and child custody. This type of divorce can facilitate open communication and reduce tension, especially when minor children are involved.
<br>
<br>However, if communication breaks down, an uncontested divorce can become contested. In such cases, a skilled Manhattan divorce attorney is essential.
<br>
<br>Contested Divorce:
<br>A contested divorce involves disputes over significant issues, often leading to court proceedings where a judge makes the final decisions. This process can be lengthy and increase tension between the parties.
<br>
<br>The steps in a contested divorce include preparing, filing, and serving the divorce petition, followed by the response, divorce discovery, pre-trial hearings, settlement negotiations, and potentially a trial. If necessary, an appeal can be filed after the trial.
<br>
<br>Having an experienced divorce attorney is crucial in contested divorces. A skilled lawyer can develop strategies to resolve the case in your best interests.
<br>
<br>At the Law Office of Richard Roman Shum, our team will guide you through the contested divorce process. We strive to resolve issues through negotiations but are prepared to use aggressive strategies and take your case to trial if needed. We are committed to protecting your legal rights.
<br>
<br>Divorce is challenging and emotionally taxing. A skilled lawyer can help you navigate this process, ensuring a favorable outcome and the well-being of your children.
<br>
<br>Our firm has extensive experience in legal separation and divorce cases. Family lawyer Richard Shum and our team are dedicated to providing top-notch representation in New York City. Our reputation and numerous positive client reviews speak for themselves.

                            </p><h2>Richard Roman Shum, Family Lawyer, Outlines Divorce Grounds in New York</h2><p>In New York, there are several grounds for divorce. “Grounds” refer to the legally acceptable reasons for seeking a divorce. One common ground is the “no-fault” divorce, also known as “Irretrievable Breakdown.” This occurs when both parties agree that the marriage has irretrievably broken down over the past six months. In other states, this is often referred to as irreconcilable differences.
<br>
<br>A no-fault divorce is only granted after key issues such as property distribution, spousal support, child support, visitation and custody, and debts are resolved by the couple or determined by the court.
<br>
<br>Other grounds for divorce in New York include:
<br>
<br>-Cruel and Inhuman Treatment: Physical, verbal, or emotional abuse that endangers a person’s well-being. If it is unsafe for the petitioner to live with the other person, they may file for divorce. The judge will examine specific instances of abuse before granting the divorce.
<br>-Abandonment: This ground can be used if one spouse abandons the other for at least a year. Refusal to engage in sexual relations can also be considered abandonment, known as “constructive abandonment.”
<br>-Imprisonment: If one spouse has been in prison for three or more years consecutively, this can be a ground for divorce, provided the sentence started after the marriage. Divorce can be filed even if the spouse is still in prison, up to five years after their release.
<br>-Adultery: Evidence from a third party is required to prove that one spouse committed adultery.
<br>-Judgment of Separation: If both spouses have been separated by a separation agreement for over a year, they may use it as grounds for divorce. They can follow the terms of the separation agreement instead of drafting a new one for the divorce. The couple must have lived separately for a year after the agreement before using this ground.

<br>Manhattan High Net Worth Divorce Lawyer
<br>
<br>Navigating a high-net-worth divorce in Manhattan requires the counsel of an experienced attorney who can handle the complexities of such cases. Typically, a high-net-worth divorce involves over one million dollars in net liquid assets and is subject to New York’s law of equitable distribution of marital assets. In today’s landscape, these divorces can involve even higher liquid assets, making it crucial to have a knowledgeable attorney like Richard Roman Shum.
<br>
<br>The process of equitable distribution in New York State involves identifying assets, categorizing them as marital, separate, or a combination of both, valuing the marital assets, and equitably distributing them. The valuation, distribution, and identification of assets in high-net-worth divorces can be particularly complex.

With his experience, clients can navigate the complexities of high-net-worth divorces more effectively, ensuring a just and equitable outcome. Call The Law Office of Richard Roman Shum today to schedule a consultation.
<br>
<br>In New York, certain requirements must be met before the courts will consider issuing a divorce decree. One requirement is the residency requirement, where at least one of the parties must have been a resident of the state for at least 60 days prior to filing the petition. Proof of residency can be provided through a driver’s license, lease, or other documents.
<br>
<br>Exceptions to the residency requirement include individuals stationed on a military post within the state for 60 days before filing the petition, even if not permanently residing in the state.
<br>
<br>Meeting these requirements is crucial to avoid delays in the divorce process. Establishing residency allows the divorce to proceed.
<br>
<br>A skilled divorce lawyer can ensure all requirements are met. Speak to the experienced Manhattan attorneys at the Law Office of Richard Roman Shum today to schedule a free consultation.&nbsp;<br></p>
